### ??? SL/TP Configuration for Gold

#### High Win Rate (70-80%):
```python
sl_distance = atr * 1.5   # Wider SL = less stop outs
tp_distance = atr * 0.8   # Tight TP = faster wins
# Typical: SL = $6-8, TP = $3-5
```

#### Balanced (60-70% win rate, profitable):
```python
sl_distance = atr * 1.2   # Moderate SL
tp_distance = atr * 1.0   # Equal TP
# Typical: SL = $5-6, TP = $5-6
```

#### Aggressive (50-60% win rate, high profit per trade):
```python
sl_distance = atr * 1.0   # Tight SL
tp_distance = atr * 1.5   # Larger TP
# Typical: SL = $4-5, TP = $6-8
```
